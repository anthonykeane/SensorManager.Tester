This is an example application to demonstrate how to use the ES2 Library
which can be found here: https://github.com/nlathia/SensorManager

WARNING:
We are using this tester app to test the dev branch of the SensorManager!

It uses a separate library to format data as JSON strings.
This library can be found here:
https://github.com/nlathia/SensorDataManager

This application's user interface uses Android fragments and therefore requires
Android 3.0 and above. However, we note that the ES Library has been tested with
Android 2.3.3 and above. For a version of this tester app that does not require
fragments, please see: https://github.com/nlathia/SensorManager.Tester2
